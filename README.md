# Personal Library
The Personal Library is your very own BOOK DATABASE! It is a great way to keep track of your favorite books, or books you want to read in the future. It allows a user to add a book with title and a cover photo, and independently an author and notes to attach to the books you are adding. Stop taking screenshots of books that you'll end up accidently deleting and keep your reading list up-to-date with The Personal Library!

## Installation

Get the code from https://github.com/skvisual/personal_library

Run the mySQL using source schema.sql

Open your favorite browser and navigate to localhost:8080

You are ready to start building your very own Library!

## Future Developments

4/10/20 - I plan to update the styling of the application to a more contemporary layout.
